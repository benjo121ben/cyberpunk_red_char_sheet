Besides giving you a measure of protection, a Bodyweight Suit also has a place to store your Cyberdeck and supports your Interface Plugs so they stay out of the way while you're busy brain-burning that fool who just dared to pop a Hellhound on you. Many Netrunners wear clothing over their Bodyweight Suits, but plenty don't. It's a matter of personal style. <strong>Unlike other armor, a Bodyweight Suit isn't bought in two pieces, and must always be worn on both your body and head location</strong>. Each location has its own SP11. When repaired, both pieces are repaired at the same time. You can't wear more than one Bodyweight Suit. <strong>Wearing a Bodyweight Suit adds one Hardware only Option Slot to a Cyberdeck connected to it.</strong> Hardware installed in the Bodyweight Suit cannot be accessed if the armor isn't worn and can only take up 1 Option Slot.</p>",
