When using this ammunition, whenever you miss a shot by 4 or less when using a weapon's single shot firing mode, your missed shot immediately has a second chance to hit your target. This second chance to hit is made by rolling again to hit the exact same shot DV on the range table which you missed, except that you add 10 to the d10 instead of anything you would typically add to the Check, with the only exception being LUCK. A target that can dodge bullets can choose to dodge this ranged attack as normal.</p>",
