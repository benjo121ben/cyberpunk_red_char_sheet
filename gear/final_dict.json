While in stasis, targets are unconscious and no longer roll any Death Saves for up to a week, as long as they remain inside the bag and the bag has at least 1 HP. A Character in a cryopump bag is considered to be behind a piece of cover that has 15 HP. The bag's transparent top and gloves molded into the lining allow the target to undergo surgery and be stabilized while in stasis, which is much less dangerous to the patient. A standard Cryopump has only 1 charge and can only hold a single roughly humansized target.
